** Another week to be crazyüôâ excited

For this issue: While on a surfboard, kite in one hand smartphone in the other and hold on, wind is our theme this time (with matching gif of course).

We all know sailing is the oldest and cleanest way to travel through water. We set sail to a beginning of cleaner transportation vessels and we're surfing üèÑ Hawaii's waves while generating power.

But first, people tend to go on holidays this time a year. [Why not in a fully self-sufficient egg shaped caravan?](http://www.ecocapsule.sk/)

##[Living in an egg has never felt this good](http://www.ecocapsule.sk/ecocapsule)  üê£

Each year we huddle around packed camping sites with our caravans. With this ecocapsule you can settle everywhere you like. Enjoy the outdoors and never worry about electricity or clean drinking water.

[This portable home wil get you electricity by generating wind and solar power.](http://www.ecocapsule.sk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/schemy-energo1-1024x354.png) Also no worries forclean water thanks to their rainwater filtering system.

Fortunately we have some time to save money. This egg is not reaching the market until next year.
(This definitely was not an advertorial, we just want our office in these things. Oh, euhm... does it has wifi?)

##[Surfing on waves provides power on US power grid](http://www.popsci.com/waves-are-adding-power-grid-hawaii)

The photo above shows Azura. It surfs the oceans waves üåä near the coast of Hawaii and generates power to the Island. For the first time in the US energy collected from waves are turned into useful electricity.

[Almost half the population](http://coastalchallenges.com/2010/01/31/un-atlas-60-of-us-live-in-the-coastal-areas/)  üë´ lives within 150 km of the worlds coastlines. This means that they're the population who can benefit from these wave machines.

##[Recharging batteries while sailing](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150713005345/en/North-Sailing-Milestone-Eco-Friendly-Transportation), [can it change transportation over seas?](http://www.zdnet.com/article/sails-to-power-future-cargo-ships-global-trade/)

First of all, watch the Prime Minister of Iceland wearing his Scandinavian sweater with proud!

[Iceland](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/IJsland/@60.5433547,-17.688498,4.73z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48d22b52a3eb6043:0x6f8a0434e5c1459a) has reached a milestone in eco-friendly transportation. The 'Opel' ship is used for a well known tourist attraction: whale üê≥ spotting.

The electric motor will silently propel the boat, but when the ship is under sails, the propeller blades can be modified and used to recharge the ship‚Äôs batteries. A very simpel idea you think? This technique has never been used on a sea vessel before!

Maritime shipping üö¢ is [still the most](http://www.worldshipping.org/industry-issues/environment/air-emissions/carbon-emissions) carbon-efficient form of transport. Yet, [as 4%](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/09/shipping-pollution) of global emissions still comes from the industry and the 15 biggest ships emit as much as all 760 million cars, it needs to further improve carbon efficiency.

Why not put sails on our big transporting vessels who are transporting 90% in tonnes of our world trade? Is this too much to ask? Definitely not, click on sailboat [‚õµ](http://www.zdnet.com/article/sails-to-power-future-cargo-ships-global-trade/)  to find out.

##[Renewable energy is winning from fossil fuels](https://theconversation.com/how-much-does-wind-energy-cost-debunking-the-myths-43710)

With new wind farms it's estimated that relative costs of wind energy are the same or cheaper than that of coal. You like the sound of that, fossil conservatives?

A much heard critique is that wind energy isn't reliable and so there is a need for fossil back-up start generators. In South Australia for example, more than 1,200 megawatts of wind power capacity has been installed, but virtually no new gas plants have been built as ‚Äúbackup‚Äù.

Director of cleantechnica.com also shows us in a passionate lecture at PechKucha that renewable energy is winning. [See for yourself in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUr95Uj7-2E) .
